Project Overview

The Inventory Management System helps manage a store's inventory by adding items, updating stock, checking availability, and generating sales reports. It integrates dictionaries for structured data, error handling for invalid inputs, and logic operations for decision-making, making it a comprehensive and practical project.


Challenge

Create an empty dictionary named inventory to store item details. Each key in this dictionary will represent an item's name, and its value will be another dictionary containing:

price (float): The price of the item.
stock (int): The quantity of the item in stock.
Add the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

print(inventory)  # Should output: {}
"""

inventory = {}
print(inventory)
