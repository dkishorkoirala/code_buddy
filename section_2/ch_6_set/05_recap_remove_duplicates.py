Recap - Remove Duplicates

In Python, you can convert a list to a set using the set() function. This is called casting. Casting to a set transforms the list into a set, which contains only unique elements.

Example:

my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
my_set = set(my_list)
print(my_set)
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Challenge

Write a function named remove_duplicates that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list with duplicates removed while preserving the original order of elements.

Example Input:

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Example Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Use the properties of sets to simplify your solution while keeping the order intact!

    # Write code here
    s = set(numbers)
    return list(s)
