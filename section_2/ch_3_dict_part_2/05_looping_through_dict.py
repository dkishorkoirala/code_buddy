Looping Through Dictionaries

Looping through a dictionary allows you to access each key-value pair and perform operations on them. Python provides several ways to iterate through dictionaries, making it easy to work with their contents.

Looping through keys:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
Output:

name
age
city
Looping through values:

for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)
Output:

Alice
30
New York
Looping through key-value pairs:

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value}')
Output:

name: Alice
age: 30
city: New York
In these examples, the first loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary. The second loop iterates over the values using the values() method. The third loop uses the items() method to iterate over both keys and values simultaneously.


Challenge

Create a function named print_employee_details that takes a dictionary employee_data as an argument. The function should loop through the dictionary and print each key-value pair in the format 'key: value'. If the dictionary is empty, the function should print 'No data available'.
"""


def print_employee_details(employee_data):
    # Write code here
    if not employee_data:
        print("No data available")
    else:
        for k, v in employee_data.items():
            print(f"{k}: {v}")
