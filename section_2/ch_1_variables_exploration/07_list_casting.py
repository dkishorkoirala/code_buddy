List Casting

You can use the list() function to cast iterables like tuples, strings, or ranges into lists. This is useful for working with elements in a modifiable format.

Casting a tuple to a list:

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3]
Casting a string splits it into individual characters:

my_string = "hello"
my_list = list(my_string)
print(my_list)  # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
Casting a range to a list gives all the numbers at once:

my_range = range(5)
my_list = list(my_range)
print(my_list)  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
You can also cast to other types like set or dict, but youâ€™ll explore those later. For now, focus on list() to handle and transform data flexibly!

Challenge

Convert the following data into lists using the list() function:

A tuple: (10, 20, 30)
A string: "python"
A range: range(1, 6)
Print the resulting lists.

Example Output:

[10, 20, 30]
['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
This challenge reinforces using list() to cast different iterables into lists.

# Write code here
t = (10, 20, 30)
s = "python"
r = range(1, 6)
print(list(t))
print(list(s))
print(list(r))
