Creating Simple Lists

Now that you know the syntax of list comprehensions, let’s dive into some simple examples to see how they can be used to create new lists quickly and efficiently.

Create a list of cube numbers:

cubes = [x**3 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(cubes)
# Output: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
Create a list of strings from characters:

chars = [char for char in "hello"]
print(chars)
# Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
Generate a list of even numbers:

evens = [x for x in range(2, 11, 2)]
print(evens)
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Convert all items in a list to uppercase:

words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
uppercase = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(uppercase)
# Output: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
List comprehensions make it easy to work with sequences, apply transformations, and even include conditions—all in one line!


Challenge

Create a function named get_word_lengths that takes a list of words as an argument and returns a list of the lengths of each word using a list comprehension.
"""


def get_word_lengths(words):
    # Write code here
    lst = [len(word) for word in words]
    return lst


word = ["python", "list", "comprehension", "challenge"]
print(get_word_lengths(word))
