Iterating Over Sets

Iterating over a set is similar to iterating over a list or a dictionary. You can use a for loop to go through each element in a set. However, it's important to remember that sets are unordered, so the elements will not be processed in a specific sequence.

Here's an example of iterating over a set:

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for element in my_set:
    print(element)
Output:

1
2
3
4
5
In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in my_set and prints it. The order of the elements in the output may vary because sets do not maintain a specific order.

If you need to access the elements of a set in a specific order, you can convert the set to a list and then iterate over the sorted list:

my_set = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3}
sorted_list = sorted(list(my_set))
for element in sorted_list:
    print(element)
Output:

1
2
3
5
8
In this example, we first convert my_set to a list using list(my_set), then sort the list using sorted(). The for loop then iterates over the sorted list, printing each element in ascending order.


Challenge

Create a function named iterate_and_filter_set that takes a set input_set as an argument. The function should iterate over the elements in the set and filter out numbers that are greater than 10. The function should return a new set containing only the numbers that are less than or equal to 10.

def iterate_and_filter_set(input_set):
    # Write code
    filtered_set = {num for num in input_set if num <= 10}
    return filtered_set
