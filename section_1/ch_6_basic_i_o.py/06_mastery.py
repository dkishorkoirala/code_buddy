Challenge

Write a program that takes two inputs from the user. These inputs should be treated as numbers with decimal points.

Store the inputs in two variables, convert them to float type, and print the result of dividing the first number by the second number.

Remember, every test case will provide two inputs.
"""

num1 = float(input())
num2 = float(input())

print(num1 / num2)
