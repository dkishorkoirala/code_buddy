You are given a code with initialization of score. (Don't delete this line!)

Your task is to modify the score variable using arithmetic shortcuts, in this order:

Add 10 to score
Multiply score by 3
Remember to use the arithmetic shortcuts for each operation!
"""

# Type your code below
score = 100
score /= 2
score += 10
score *= 3

# Don't change the line below
print(f"score = {score}")
