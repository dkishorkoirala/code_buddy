Project Overview

You will build a simple program to manage daily expenses.

The user can add, view, and clear expenses, as well as calculate the total and average.

This project reinforces basic programming concepts like lists, loops, and functions in a practical, real-life scenario.


Challenge

As always, output a welcome message to the program:

print("Welcome to the Daily Expense Tracker!")
After this, add a new line and output the menu:

Menu:
1. Add a new expense
2. View all expenses
3. Calculate total and average expense
4. Clear all expenses
5. Exit
"""

MENU = """
Menu:
1. Add a new expense
2. View all expenses
3. Calculate total and average expense
4. Clear all expenses
5. Exit
"""
print("Welcome to the Daily Expense Tracker!")
print(MENU)
