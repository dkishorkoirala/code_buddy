# Recap - Initialize Variables

# Let's recap variables!


# Challenge

# Write code that initializes the following variables:

# k with the value 88
# PI with the value 3.14
# name with the value "bob"
# Make sure you use the exact variables names and values. Remember, Python is case sensitive!

# Type your code below
k = 88
PI = 3.14
name = "bob"

# Don't change the line below
print(f"k = {k}")
print(f"PI = {PI}")
print(f"name = {name}")
