# String

# A char is a single character (for example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.)

# The str (string) type is a special type that consists of multiple chars.

# To initialize a string value in a variable, enclose it within single or double quotation marks:

# s1 = 'This is a string'
# s2 = "This is also a string"
# In the above example, two string variables are initialized, named s1 and s2.

# challenge:
# Store the string I am learning to code with Coddy! in a variable named coddy.

# Be sure to store the exact string value with correct casing.

# Type your code below
coddy = "I am learning to code with Coddy!"

# Don't change the line below
print(f'coddy = "{coddy}"')
