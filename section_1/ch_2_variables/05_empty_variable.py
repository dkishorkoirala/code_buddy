# Empty Variables

# In Python, None is a special value that represents "nothing" or "no value." It's like an empty box - it exists, but there's nothing inside it. For example:

# empty_box = None
# In a real scenario you could use None to indicate that something was not initialized yet.

# For example:

# score = None  # Score hasn't been calculated yet
# name = None   # Name hasn't been entered yet

# Challenge

# Declare a variable named nothing and assign it the value None.

# Type your code below
nothing = None

# Don't change the line below
print(f"nothing = {nothing}")
