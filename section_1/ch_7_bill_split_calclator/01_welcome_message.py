Welcome Message

Did you know that splitting a bill with friends can be super easy with a little bit of Python?

In this project, you'll create a simple program that calculates how much each person needs to pay, including the tip. It’s a practical way to apply what you’ve learned about variables, arithmetic operations, and basic input/output. By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a handy tool to use in real-life situations! Let’s get started!


Challenge


Every good program starts with a welcome message, output to the screen the following string:

print("Bill Split Calculator")
