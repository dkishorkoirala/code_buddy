# Comments

# Comments are used to add explanatory notes within the code. They are ignored by the compiler and are meant for human understanding.

# In Python, there are two ways to write comments:

# Single-line comments using the # symbol:

# # This is a comment
# print("Hello!")  # This prints "Hello!"

# # You can use comments to explain your code
# print("Python is fun!")  # This will show on the screen
# Multi-line comments using triple quotes ("""):

# """
# This is a multi-line comment.
# You can write multiple lines
# of explanation here.
# """
# print("Welcome!")
